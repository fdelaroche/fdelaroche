## About

Senior Software Developer in Test with 7 years of experience specializing in scalable UI and API automation, and 11 years in Quality Assurance role.

I design and integrate quality frameworks directly into CI/CD pipelines, enabling rapid, reliable delivery across complex, large-scale systems. Leveraging a QC mindset informed by development practices, I advocate for strong product testability.

I am currently transitioning into a core development role, focused on building robust software solutions with an inherent Quality Control perspective.

Motto: One man's software doesn't have to be another man's nightmare.
